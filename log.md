# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started planning / setting up Webpack build process for a small Redux/React app

**Thoughts:** This is the part that feels the most daunting, hopefully I'll get to the point where it's actually fun after this!

**Link to work:** no links as of yet
