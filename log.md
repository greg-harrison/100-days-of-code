# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started planning / setting up Webpack build process for a small Redux/React app

**Thoughts:** This is the part that feels the most daunting, hopefully I'll get to the point where it's actually fun after this!

**Link to work:** no links as of yet

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got some of the Webpack stuff set-up and added some dependencies.

**Thoughts:** Getting all of this set up takes a little bit of time, since I want to get an understanding of Webpack. Also, I decided I'd go with ReactRouter for this project, since there seems to be a lot of documentation surrounding React/ReactRouter/Redux. Keeping it going :D
